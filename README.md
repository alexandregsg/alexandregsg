# Hi, I'm Alexandre! 👋

I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Finance at Nova School of Business and Economics, after completing a postgraduate degree in Data Science at NOVA IMS and a bachelor's in Economics from the University of Coimbra.

My academic journey combines finance, economics, and data science, giving me a solid foundation in statistical analysis, programming, and economic modeling. I'm particularly interested in how data-driven techniques can improve financial decision-making and economic policy.

### 📚 Recent Projects:

* **Econometric analysis** of political factors influencing renewable energy investment in Europe.
* **Cost analysis** of healthcare complications for the Portuguese National Health Service using decision-tree modeling.
* **Automation of financial processes** and improvement of internal systems through internships in consulting and project management.
